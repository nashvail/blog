        <span className={s_.firstcharacter}>I</span> can't decide if it's the
        loud mating calls of the birds, or the nostril popping cold, fresh air
        that make me love early mornings so much. Or, with over half of us still
        asleep, maybe it's the momentary illusion of fewer humans on earth that
        makes early mornings special. Or maybe it's just in my genes. Some
        people like early mornings, some don't. Which, I will never understand,
        how can someone not like early mornings? Especially when it comes with
        the horny, sweet mating calls. Of the birds, of course.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since mornings are so precious to me I have taught myself to fall asleep
        early. It required baking in certain habits in the last few hours that
        lead to sleep. For example, no junk food, or coffee, or watching or
        reading something that sends my mind into a whirlwind of thoughts.
        Basically, saying no to anything that can potentially induce insomnia.
      </p>
      <p>
        But show me a man who sticks to his habits and I'll show you a ... well
        rounded disciplined person. Which I am not, yet. That one night I found
        myself watching the movie "Her", way past my bedtime. Her is one of
        those Sci-Fi movies where technology has progressed to a point where
        computers have started to sound real and even behave real, so real that
        you can fall in love with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Literally, love. Which as much as I know is sharing details of your day
        over texts and calls, but anyway. So this person, Theodore, in the movie
        falls in love with his computer, which I thought would be weird when
        it's eventually confessed to a friend halfway through the movie, but
        instead, all his friend asked was ... "Is it (Theodore's relationship
        with his computer) real?" and even though I hoped for a conclusion, the
        whole scene ended with an "I don't know" from both sides. And I was
        stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        My brain picked this up and started questioning everything digital,
        everything that doesn't exist outside of a screen, and then, it was 2
        AM. My plans of waking up at 5:30 AM was obliterated of course, along
        with it died the pride I take in my work?
      </p>
      <p>
        A good part of the population and yes, me and even you spend hours
        creating things that only exist as flickering lights on a thin glass
        slab. I am talking about apps and games and all the other things that we
        use on our little phones and tablets and laptops. The smartest minds
        today come together each morning and essentially discuss how the pixels
        on the screens of their users are going to glow.
      </p>

      <p>
        What these people build, or you build and I build is digital, with no
        tangible real existence and when I think of things this way, everything
        seems a little synthetic. It’s as if I go back to a time before
        technology and show the people of past a piece of software on an iPad
        that my team built, and these people who are seeing either sow seeds or
        build real things, like buildings and vases, castles and pyramids. I am
        afraid that one of them is going to look into the screen and question,
        “is it real?” And I am afraid I won’t have an instant answer to puke out
        and our conversation will quickly turn into an argument of me insisting
        YES, mostly just to save my pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did let the question of, is the work we do real stay with me and even
        spread the pollens of it over almost everyone I met in the weeks
        following that night. Here's the most common answer and probably the
        only one I got, "Yes, the work we do is real because it has real world
        impacts". Correct. I don't disagree, except just a small part of me
        which likes print design and seeing things go from screen to something
        that I can touch and hold and wear, that part still finds the digital
        work synthetic. But it doesn't matter, because it's true, reality today
        *is* shaped by the glowing pixels. It's a crazy thought if you ponder,
        that something can not exist in reality and still shape it. That's the
        power of screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not that the screens are controlling autonomous evil beings, it's
        still us, the humans, congregated in corporations controlling rest of
        the population through screens. And because screens are so ubiqutous the
        power to control and brainwash has been grossly magnified in the past
        few decades. I bet from where you're sitting, if you get up and walk to
        the door closest to you, on the way you'll encounter more than 3 screens
        either kept on tables or held in hands, or raised slightly above eye
        level with the front camera on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hell I can even make it a 10 or 20 and it'll be true. I mean even you’re
        looking at a screen right now, and I am channeling my thoughts through
        it into your heads, thoughts that can potentially change the way you
        look at the world, at least for a week or even a lifetime, who knows. I
        couldnt have done this before screens. There were just two ways, publish
        what I have to say in print, which is a hell lot hard than publishing an
        unedited pile of thoughts I had at 2AM on my website. Or, stand at a
        busy intersection and shout and expect 4 people to hear it and even one
        of them to come and ask me to shut up. You can't do that now, you can't
        kick me off my shouting pedestal. And it's just not me, it's everybody.
        Channeling and consuming and shaping through twitter and facebook and
        instagram. It's too much.

        The human brain is not designed to absorb such amounts of bullshit 24/7.
        The constant overload of mostly useless information, like where Becky is
        having her vacation or the pictures of Jonthan’s kid or the fact that
        someone went paragliding for the first time, all of this quickly turns
        your brain into a mush and you into a lab rat constantly chasing and
        clicking this tapping that scrolling there. The biggest part of the
        problem is that you cannot do much about it. There are people far
        smarter than you, with PhDs and in labcoats building all of this to
        constantly keep you hooked. They know your dopamine hit points,
        everything is engineered to keep you addicted, turn you into a junkie
        for notifications, and if you don't stop, pause and think you're going
        to drive yourself insane. You're already halfway there, if a screen is
        the first thing you look at in the morning and the last thing at night,
        we really need to talk.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know how it is. How it feels almost impossible to resist looking at
        the phone the second you wake up. People don’t want to get bored
        anymore, it’s as if boredom bites them, scratches the insides of their
        skulls, puts a saliva soaked fingertip inside their ears, wets their
        socks, nibbles on their earlobes or licks the side of their faces.
      </p>
      <p>
        An average person unlocks their phone 150 times a day, most of it is for
        no reason, it’s automatic, facebook sewed in our DNAs to make us want to
        check the phone over and over again. It’s your struggle against
        yourself. It’s why we look up to people who go on a tech detox for 10
        days, as if going on tech detox is an achievement, humans were on tech
        detox for 5 fucking million years you idiot, it’s tech, it’s not
        breathing/oxygen. To keep your sanity safe you will have to create
        boundaries. I have talked at length about keeping distractions
        quarantined while at work here, but today I’ll talk about what you can
        do outside work, your daily life, how you can find a bubble for yourself
        that’ll shield you from all the noise. How in the constant chaos you can
        find for yourself small pockets of solitude.

        <span className={s_.firstcharacter}>I</span>t is believed that forming a
        habit is easier if you anchor it to something existing, like meditating
        after you've taken a shower or reading a book before going to sleep
        e.t.c e.t.c e.t.c. A while ago I decided I'll check my phone in the
        morning only after I have brushed my teeth. So since then, from the
        moment I wake up, drink water, take a shit, brush my teeth, gag on my
        tongue cleaner to when I wash and wipe my face, I am offline. The first
        30 minutes of my day is for me. It's not easy, you realise how tough it
        is to sit on the crapper, alone, with just your thoughts. You feel me?
        Yes? That's exactly why you need to follow this.

        Epicurus, an old time greek philosopher said, “To eat and drink without
        a friend is to devour like the lion and the wolf.”. Which is to eat like
        animals, eluding to the fact that humans are social creatures and it's
        kinda odd to sit and eat alone. And that being a social animal part of
        our being that has been carried from hunting and living in small groups
        is the reason for the stigma against doing things alone. It feels
        uncomfortable both to the person doing it and to the ones watching it.
        Of course you're up for it never miss a chance of just hanging out but
        it's not the cave times anymore. We're a subject to over-socialisaiton
        which might be a good thing if it was online, but right now it's through
        screens. We're as a species aren't designed to socialise through screens
        and even though you can have an hour long chat with your close buddies
        on a whatsapp group, it'll never be as satisfying as sitting around
        table making fun of Jeff. Poor Jeff, gets owned at every gathering. On
        top of that socialisation through the screens can have diminishing
        effects, according to this 1995 study. So Epicurus was correct for his
        time. If I have a choice I choose having my meals alone, not alone
        watching Netflix just me and my plate of food. For however long it takes
        to eat the entire thing I can recollect my thoughts and be with myself.
        If that's not possible I'd recommend you have an evening snack,
        preferably healthy, alone and offline.

        For the rest of the day, a good part of which is spent working I try my
        best to stick with what I discuss in this article of mine here. TL;DR
        work in blocks and for the blocks have your notifications turned off and
        social and other time chewing sites blocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there's one thing you take away from this article, it's this, allow
        yourself to be bored. If you're waiting in a queue watch out don't just
        leap for your phone, wait, think. And if nothing works just force
        yourself to lie down and stare at the fucking ceiling for 30 minutes,
        realise your brain is buzzing with all the scrolling and tapping all day
        long. If you don't feel the nausea, you're good, maybe we're evolving
        towards being sane in the face of mind numbing information flooding.
        Which is a good thing. This article was born out of my personal
        frustration from watching people around me constantly picking up and
        staring at their phones, erasing their fingeprints against the glass.
        Even as I was closing this article, I looked up from my laptop, I
        noticed the phone on the desk in-front of me buzzed, it was my
        coworker’s, he picked it up, unlocked it and as the blue light from it
        flooded his tired eyes, he smiled.

        <span className={s_.firstcharacter}>I</span> can't decide if it's the
        loud mating calls of the birds, or the nostril popping cold, fresh air
        that makes me love early mornings so much. Or, with over half of us
        still asleep, maybe it's the momentary illusion of fewer humans on earth
        that makes early mornings special. Or maybe it's just me. Some people
        like early mornings, some don't. Which, I will never understand. How can
        someone not like early mornings? Especially when it comes with the
        horny, sweet mating calls. Of the birds, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since mornings are so precious to me I have taught myself to fall asleep
        early. It required baking in certain habits in the last few hours that
        lead to sleep. For example, no junk food, or coffee, or watching or
        reading something that sends my mind into a whirlwind of thoughts.
        Basically, saying no to anything that can potentially induce insomnia.
      </p>
      <p>
        But show me a man who sticks to his habits and I'll show you a ... well
        rounded disciplined person. Which I am not, yet.

        That one night I found myself watching the movie{" "}
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/" target="__blank">
          Her
        </a>
        , way past my bedtime. Her is one of those Sci-Fi movies where
        technology has progressed to a point where computers have started to
        sound, behave and understand you just like an actual human. So much so
        that you can fall in love with one. And that's exactly what happens in
        the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        So this person, Theodore, played by Joaquin Phoenix who also plays Joker
        in the 2019 movie, Joker falls in love with his computer, or to be more
        specific, with the{" "}
        <a href="http://apple.com/siri" target="__blank">
          Siri
        </a>{" "}
        like AI that lives inside it. This, I thought would be weird when it's
        eventually confessed to a friend halfway through the movie, but instead,
        all his friend asked was ... "Is it (Theodore's relationship with his
        computer) real?" and even though I hoped for a conclusion, the whole
        scene ended with an "I don't know" from both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intuition tells us that of-course the "relationship" between Theodore
        and his AI girlfriend isn't real. But why isn't it "real"? And how do we
        define "real"? Is it not real because it's not a relationship between
        two humans, but rather a human and machine? The emotions that Theodore
        feels aren't real because they're for something that exists only behind
        a screen? Well, in that case, there's something more we should be
        questioning is real.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good part of the population and yes, me and possibly even you spend
        hours creating things that only exist as flickering lights inside a
        screen. I am talking about the apps and the games and the websites and
        all the other things that we use on our little phones and tablets and
        laptops.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we build is digital, with no tangible, real existence. Does that
        mean the things we build and the work we do isn't, real?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, the work we do is real because it has real world impacts", is what
        I got from almost everyone I asked if the work they produce is digital
        and do they consider it real. And I don't disagree with the statement,
        because it's true, reality today is shaped by glowing pixels. It's a
        crazy thought if you ponder, that something can not exist in reality and
        still shape it. That's the power of screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not that the screens are controlling autonomous evil beings, it's
        still us, the humans, congregated in corporations controlling rest of
        the population through screens. And because screens are so ubiquitous
        the power to control and brainwash has been grossly magnified in the
        past few decades. I bet from where you're sitting, if you get up and
        walk to the door closest to you, on the way you'll encounter at least 3
        screens with more than 3 faces stuck to them.

        I can even make it a 10 or 20 and it'll be true. Even you’re looking at
        a screen right now, and I am channeling my thoughts through it into your
        heads, thoughts that can potentially change the way you look at the
        world, at least for a week or even a lifetime, who knows. I couldn't
        have done this "before the screens". There were just two ways, publish
        what I have to say in print, which is a hell lot harder than publishing
        an unedited pile of thoughts I had at 2AM. Or, stand at a busy
        intersection, shout my ideas and expect 4 people to listen and even one
        of them to come and ask me to shut up.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can't do that now, you can't kick me off my shouting pedestal. And
        it's just not me, it's everybody. Channeling and consuming and shaping
        through Twitter and Facebook and Instagram. It's too much.
      </p>

        The human brain is not designed to absorb such amounts of bullshit 24/7.
        The constant overload of mostly useless information, like where Becky is
        having her vacation or the pictures of Jonathan’s kid or the fact that
        someone went paragliding for the first time, all of this quickly turns
        your brain into a mush and you into a lab rat constantly chasing and
        clicking this tapping that scrolling there.

        The biggest part of the problem is that you cannot do much about it.
        There are people far smarter than you, with PhDs and who wear lab-coats.
        They know your dopamine hit points, everything is engineered to keep you
        addicted, turn you into a junkie for notifications, and if you don't
        stop, pause and think you're going to drive yourself insane. You're
        already halfway there, if a screen is the first thing you look at in the
        morning and the last thing at night, we really need to talk.

        <span className={s_.firstcharacter}>I</span>t's not everyday, but there
        are days, and weeks when the brain feels like it's been wrung out of the
        juice, dry. Dry like squeezed meat, so dry that if you dropped it to the
        floor it won't plop, stick and spread like honey. It'd bounce a little
        and roll to a corner or wherever the air from the fan takes it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In days like those what has helped me, is creating small pockets of
        isolation, from technology <i>and</i> people. It's not just turning your
        phone off and locking yourself in a room, if it was, I'd have told you
        so in the first paragraph and vanished. There's more to creating these
        moments of isolation, or what I like to call, creating these Pockets of
        Solitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did I tell you? Mornings are my favorite time of the day. Morning for
        you is when you wake up, if you wake up at noon, hey that's your morning
        alright, no judgement. It's what you do after waking up that's worth
        judging. For example, it's not a good idea to unlock your phone the
        first thing after you've let your eyelids up when your brain is already
        buzzing.
      </p>

      <p>
        A while ago I made a simple decision to check my phone only after I am
        done with my morning chores. So since then, from the moment I wake up,
        drink water, take a shit, brush my teeth, gag on my tongue cleaner to
        when I wash and wipe my face, I am offline. The first 30 minutes of my
        day makes my first pocket of solitude. Sitting on the crapper, alone,
        without your phone and with just your thoughts isn't as easy as you
        think. But it's a good way to start the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Epicurus, an old time greek philosopher said, “To eat and drink without
        a friend is to devour like the lion and the wolf.”. Which is, to eat
        like animals, alluding to the fact that humans are social creatures and
        it's kinda odd to sit and eat alone, ergo have friends, be happy e.t.c
        e.t.c. But, Epicurus is fucking dead! We're now subject to
        over-socialisation, even if it's just through the screens.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I have a choice I choose having my meals alone, not alone watching
        Netflix just me and my plate of food. For however long it takes to eat I
        can recollect my thoughts and be with myself. If that's not possible for
        you I'd recommend having your evening snack, preferably healthy, alone
        and offline. That's another way to create yet another pocket of
        solitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your work makes up a large part of your day. And even though it's
        general advice that constant context switching between social media and
        the work before you kills brain cells, don't do it! We're too
        destructive of a species to listen to good advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there is a way, which I learnt from the book Deep Work, I talk more
        about it <Link to="/blog/deep-work">here</Link>. TL;DR work in blocks
        and for the blocks have your notifications turned off and social and
        other time chewing sites blocked. All the working blocks are yet another
        small pockets of solitude.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have discovered the more of such pockets I sprinkle throughout my day,
        the better I feel at the end of it. At it's core the idea of making
        pockets of solitude is deliberately allowing yourself to get bored. And
        getting bored is not such a bad thing, especially when it's helping you
        stay sane. If you're waiting in a queue watch out don't just leap for
        your phone, wait, think. Make waiting in the queue a pocket of solitude.
        And if nothing works just force yourself to lie down and stare at the
        fucking ceiling for 30 minutes. There are ways and opportunities to
        create pockets of solitude, more than what I have discovered and shared
        with you in this article, I hope you find them and tweet them to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        One important thing that contributed towards me conjuring this article
        was my personal frustration from watching people around me constantly
        picking up and staring at their phones, erasing their fingerprints
        against the glass. Even as I was closing this article I noticed the
        phone on the desk in-front of me buzzed, I looked up, it was my
        coworker’s, he picked it and as the blue light from the phone flooded
        his tired eyes, he smiled.
